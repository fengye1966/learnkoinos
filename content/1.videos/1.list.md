### About Koinos

Koinos is a revolutionary blockchain designed to offer a highly customizable and upgradeable framework, aiming to provide a solution that is decentralized, efficient, and fully accessible. The unique framework of Koinos facilitates manifold functionalities, including decentralized governance, in which upgrades are managed through a system resembling a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), and the blockchain's behavior can be modified without necessitating hard forks. This adaptability feature stands out as it allows Koinos to evolve and adapt to the needs of its users continually. Koinos's Mana system offers a dynamic approach to transaction fees, allowing for a more efficient allocation of network resources and fostering a user-friendly experience.


At its core, Koinos employs a proof-of-burn consensus algorithm, introducing an innovative mechanism that merges the economics of proof-of-work with higher efficiency, making the network more decentralized and resistant to centralization. This consensus model involves users burning their KOIN tokens to receive Virtual Hash Power (VHP) allowing them to participate in block production without the need for expensive hardware. The integration of these advanced features in Koinos paves the way for a blockchain network that is more inclusive, user-centric, and capable of meeting the diverse needs of developers, businesses, and end-users.
