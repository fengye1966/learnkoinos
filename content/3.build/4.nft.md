# Launching an NFT collection

This guide allows users to manually launch an NFT collection based on current KCS-1 (Koinos Contract Standard) for NFTs. More information can be found directly on the [Kollection Docs](https://docs.kollection.app/docs/developers/intro)

The repo is built by the Kollections NFT team and is based on the `koinos-sdk-as`

The basic usage of this repo is as follows:

1. Clone and install the repo
2. Modify the contents of collections.ts to fit your NFT project
3. Compile and gather the `.wasm` and  `.abi` files.
4. Manually deploy to the Koinos main net.

## Getting Started

#### Prerequisite

You must have already setup your developer environment and installed the `koinos-sdk-as-cli` from lesson 1. If you haven't done so, please review that lesson and setup your SDK.

#### CLONE THE REPO

Clone the repo by using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/kollection-nft/collection-base
```

Enter the project folder by using the following command:

```
cd collection-base
```

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
yarn install
```

## Customize 

Customize the specifics of the NFT project by first modifying `assembly/Constants.ts`. 

Define the following:

- `NAME`: Name of the NFT collection
- `SYMBOL`: The symbol of the NFT collection
- `MINT_PRICE`: The cost to mint the NFT. Paid for by the minter.
- `MINT_FEE`: When false, minting can only be done by the owner (for pre-mints). When set to true, anyone can mint (mint on demand by user).
- `MAX_SUPPLY`: The maximum number of NFTs that may be minted.
- `URI`: Provide the metadata for your NFT collection.
- `OWNER`: The contract which owns the collection and is able to update the contract.
- `TOKEN_PAY`: Is the address of the payment token. In many cases, this will be $KOIN but can be others too, such as a future stablecoin.
- `ADDRESS_PAY` is the address where the `MINT_FEE` is sent to.

```import { Base58 } from "@koinos/sdk-as";

export namespace Constants {
  export const NAME: string = "";
  export const SYMBOL: string = "";
  export const MINT_PRICE: u64 = 0;
  export const MINT_FEE: bool = false;
  export const MAX_SUPPLY: u64 = 100000000000000;
  export const URI: string = "";
  export const OWNER: Uint8Array = Base58.decode("");

  // token mint
  export const TOKEN_PAY: Uint8Array = Base58.decode("");
  export const ADDRESS_PAY: Uint8Array = Base58.decode("");
}
```
You may also modify `/assembly/Collections.ts` to suit your project needs. Once you've made all your changes, build and debug your project with the following command:

```
yarn build:debug
```

Run unit test by using the following command:

```
yarn test
```

## Compile the contract

Once all your modifications have been made, you're now ready to build the release version. To do this, use the following command:

```
yarn build:release
```

Once the build completes, you will need to locate your `.wasm` and `.abi` file to upload to the blockchain.

Your `.wasm` file is located in the following directory:

```
/collection-base/build/release/contract.wasm
```
Your `.abi` file is located in the following directory:
```
/collection-base/abi/collections.abi
```

With these two files, generate a koinos wallet with `koinos CLI` and deploy as shown in Lesson 1.

## Mint your NFTs

Head over to [KoinosBlocks](http://koinosblocks.com) and enter the address that you uploaded your NFT smart contract to in the search bar.

Connect to Koinos Blocks with Kondor wallet that contains your NFT contract using the  `Connect Wallet ` button:

![connect-kondor](/images/connect-kondor.png "Connect Kondor")

Then scroll down to the `writeable options` as fill in the specified data:

`TO ADDRESS:` Is the address that the NFTs are being minted and sent to. NFTs cannot be minted and sent to its own wallet address!

`VALUE unit64:` Input the number of NFTs to mint in this transaction. If you previously specified the `MAX_SUPPLY` to be 10, then the maximum number you can enter here is 10 or however many more NFTs can be mitned until you reached 10.

Remember our previous discussion about rclimits from Module 2.

Sign and send, and you can play around with the `Read only methods` to check the total supply and more. To see your collection appear on the testnet version of Kollections, visit www.kollection-staging.app
