# Smart contract SDK

#### Developing on Koinos

Koinos offers multi-language support but the overwheming majority of smart contracts will likely be developed using TypeScript for Web Assembly, also known as Assembly Script. Typescript developers won't need much, if any additional work to adapt to Assembly Script.

This guide will walk the developer through the full installation and usage of the official Koinos AssemblyScript SDK known as `koinos-sdk-as`.

Once the SDK is installed, developing a Koinos smart contrac project is as simple as:

1. Generate a new project environment using the SDK.
2. Develop the proto and logic files of the smart contract
3. Compile the contract using the SDK to create the `.wasm` and `.abi` files.
4. Create a wallet address and upload the `.wasm` and `.abi` files to the blockchain using the `Koinos CLI`.

Let's begin.


## Installation

Before we install the SDK, we must ensure that the development environment has all of the required dependencies. 

We strongly recommend using a Mac or Linux to develop smart contracts. While all of these steps can be done on a Windows machine, it requires significantly more troubleshooting to set up the environment.

## Step 1: Install NodeJS

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) for your specific machine. 

___Be aware that you may need to use `nvm` or the node version manager to set the different versions of NodeJS. We have tested to ensure that version 16.13.1 works with the SDK.___

__Notes for Installation on Mac Silicone (M1/M2):__

If find an error with `NodeJS` when compiling smart contracts that appears similar to this output:
```
npm ERR! command /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js install --force
--cache=/Users/motoengineer/.npm --prefer-offline=false --prefer-online=false --offline=false --no-progress --no-save
--no-audit --include=dev --include=peer --include=optional --no-package-lock-only --no-dry-run
```
Then try running this command:
```
sudo chown -R 501:20 "/Users/{username}/.npm"
```

## Step 2: Install Google Protocol Buffers

`Protobuf` is necessary to build `.proto` files for Koinos Smart Contracts. 

Follow the instructions at the [Protobuf github repo](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) for the binarys specific to your machine.

### Intel Macs:
Use homebrew package manager to easily install protobuf for your Intel Mac using the following command:
```
brew install protobuf
```

### Apple Silicon M1/M2:

Use homebrew package manager to easily install protobuf for your Apple Silicone Machine, you may easily install protobuf for your M1 silicone chip using the following command:
```
arch -arm64 brew install protobuf
```

### Linux:
You may easily install protobuf for your machine using the following command:
```
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
```

### Windows:

We've found the following guide to be useful for installing `Protobuf` on windows, just be sure to use the latest version of `protobuff`:

[How to Install Protocol Buffers on Windows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-protocol-buffers-on-windows/)


### Verify your installation:

After installation, you may verify protoc is installed using the following commands regardless which machine you are using:


```
protoc --version
```
The response should be (exact version may vary):
```
>libprotoc 3.21.12
```
Verify the directory for protoc is in your $PATH using teh following command:
```
which protoc
```
The output should match the directory of your shell, otherwise be sure to include the path of your installation into your specific shell and try again.



__You are now ready to install the `koinos-sdk-as-cli`!__

## Step 3: Install the Official Koinos Assembly Script SDK

We will use Yarn Package Manager to perform the installation, but NPM will work as well. 

Install the Koinos AssemblyScript CLI by running this command in your terminal:

```
yarn global add @koinos/sdk-as-cli
```

The `koinos-sdk-as-cli` should be installed globally, we can check by running this command:

```
$(yarn global bin)/koinos-sdk-as-cli -V
```

The output should read `1.0.4` or the current version of the [AS SDK CLI Node package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@koinos/sdk-as-cli).

For the remainder of this guide, we will be calling `koinos-sdk-as-cli` directly. To do this, be sure to add `$(yarn global bin)` to your `PATH` to be able to use the CLI directly if it hasn't done this automatically.

__You are now ready to begin using the SDK!!!__


### Hello World

Every `koinos-sdk-as` project begins by creating the project folder. Let's use `create` to start a project called `myawesomecontract`. To begin, run the following command:

```
koinos-sdk-as-cli create myawesomecontract
```
The output should look something like this:

```
Generating contract at "/Users/tutorial/myawesomecontract"...

Contract successfully generated!

You're all set! Run the following set of commands to verify that the generated contract is correctly setup:

  cd /Users/tutorial/myawesomecontract && yarn install && yarn build:debug && yarn test
```

At the end of the output are a set of commands that you can copy and use directly. Here is a breakdown for each command what it does:

- `yarn install`: Installs all the dependencies needed for the SDK. This only needs to be ran once per a project folder. It must be executed inside the project folder.
- `yarn build:debug`: Compiles the smart contract into Web Assembly using a debug build. You should run this each time you change your smart contract so you can test it.
- `yarn test`: Runs the unit tests on the compiled smart contract.

Note: These commands can be found in the `package.json` file in your project folder. After running these commands, the output should look something like this:

```
[Describe]: contract

[Log] Hello, World!
 [Success]: ✔ should return 'hello, NAME!' RTrace: +21

    [File]: assembly/__tests__/Myawesomecontract.spec.ts
  [Groups]: 2 pass, 2 total

└───────────────────────────────┴───────┴───────┴──────┴──────┴───────────┘

Done in 3.28s.
```

After running through this process, you now have a project development folder that has been tested to function correctly. 

The core of your smart contract development work will involve the following files:

Protobuf file: `\myawesomecontract\assembly\proto\myawesomecontract.proto`.

Contract Logic: `\myawesomecontract\assembly\myawesomecontract.ts`.

### Folder Structure

Lets explore the folder structure of our `myawesomecontract` project. It will be structured as follows:

![file structure image](/images/vscode-file-structure-image.png "File structure")

#### The `abi` directory:
ABI stands for Application Binary Interface. The `.abi` file is automatically generated for you when building the contract however you do not need to upload it for your smart contract to work. Without the ABI file, it won't be possible for others to easily interact with your smart contract.

#### The  `assembly` directory:
The vast majority of the development work will be focused in the `assembly` directory.

![assembly folder image](/images/assembly-folder-image.png "Assembly directory")

- `__tests__` develop your unit tests in this directory.
- `proto` develop your protobuf defintions in this directory.
- `index.ts` contains the logical entry point of the contract. It is generated for your automatically when building your contract.
- `Myawesomecontract.boilerplate.ts` contains the auto-generated boilerplate based on your proto file defintions.  This file should be copied and the phrase `.boilerplate` should be removed. The new file is where you will develop your production level code. Each time you build your contract, this file will be replaced so never code directly on this boiler plate file.
- `Myawesomecontract.ts` is created by the user (see above).
- `tsconfig.json` tells the IDE what types are available in AssemblyScript, AS is like TypeScript but with WebAssembly types, it is automatically generated.


Let us now dig deeper into each of the two folders, `__tests__` and `proto`.


#### The `/assembly/__tests__` directory:

In `__tests__` we should have a file called `myawesomecontract.spec.ts` containing unit tests for the smart contract. Unit tests are created by the developer.

Let's have a look at the actual unit test implementation for our `Hello World` contract. Comments have been added to the code that hasn't been explained previously:

``` ts
// Import the smart contract ts file
import { Myawesomecontract } from '../Myawesomecontract';

// Import the proto ts file
import { myawesomecontract } from '../proto/myawesomecontract';

// Define a test suite
describe('contract', () => {

  // Define a unit test
  it("should return 'hello, NAME!'", () => {
    // Create a new instance of the contract class
    const c = new Myawesomecontract();

    // Instantiate the arguments of the "hello" function
    const args = new myawesomecontract.hello_arguments('World');

    // Call the "hello" function
    const res = c.hello(args);

    // Check the result of the "hello" function is what is expected
    expect(res.value).toStrictEqual('Hello, World!');
  });
});
```

#### The `/assembly/proto` directory:

The Koinos blockchain  leverages Google's [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) (Protobuf).

> Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler.

The `proto` directory should look like this:

![proto folder image](/images/proto-folder-image.png "Proto directory")

- `myawesomecontract.proto` contains the protocol buffers definitions.
- `myawesomecontract.ts` is auto-generated AssemblyScript code based on the above proto file.

Let's have a look at `myawesomecontract.proto` for our `Hello World` contract:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package myawesomecontract;

// @description Says Hello!
// @read-only true
message hello_arguments {
  string name = 1;
}

message hello_result {
  string value = 1;
}
```

We will focus on the important parts of this file:

- `package myawesomecontract` is package name to which this proto file belongs, in this case, it's the name of the smart contract.
- `message hello_arguments` is divided into 3 parts:
  - `message` indicates that we are declaring a new proto message.
  - `hello` is the name of the smart contract function this message describes, in this case `hello`.
  - `arguments` describes the arguments of the function.
- `message hello_result` the message that describes the result of the function `hello`.

A smart contract function always contains an arguments and result message (even if the message is empty). Each arguments message can have the following commented annotations:

- `@description` describes what the function does.
- `@read-only` indicates is a read only function or not. Read only functions cannot write the blockchain database.

Inside each proto message are properties. In this case, `string name = 1;`, declares a property, `name`, of type, `string`, at field number, `1`. For further information about the Protobuf definition language, you can read [Google's Protobuf documentation](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/).

Whenever the contents of the proto directory are changed, you will need to compile it again so that the new AS files get generated. To do this, run the following command:

```console
yarn build:debug
```

This command will re-generate `myawesomecontract.ts`, `index.ts`, and `myawesomecontract.boilerplate.ts`.

#### The `google` directory:
This directory contains the dependencies related specifically google protobuf.

#### The `koinos` directory:
This directory contains the dependencies related specifically the koinos blockchain.


#### The `build` directory:
The `build` directory is created when running `yarn build:release` or `yarn build:debug`.

It has two sub directories, the `debug` and `release`.  The `/build/debug` directory contains the smart contracts used for testing and is created when running `yarn build:debug`.

The `/build/release` directory contains the production smart contract `.wasm` file and is created when running `yarn build:release`. This `.wasm` file is ready to be uploaded to the Koinos Blockchain.

### Final Notes

You should now understand the folder structure of the `koinos-sdk-as-cli` boiler plates made by the `create` command.

## Compiling and building

When you've finished creating your code and completed all of your tests, we can build the release version and upload it to the blockchain.

For our `hello world` example contract, we'll build the release version by running the following command:

```
yarn build:release
```
The output should look something like this:
```
yarn run v1.22.15
$ koinos-sdk-as-cli build-all release 0 myawesomecontract.proto
Generating ABI file...
 yarn protoc --plugin=protoc-gen-abi=./node_modules/.bin/koinos-abi-proto-gen --abi_out=abi/ assembly/proto/myawesomecontract.proto

Compiling index.ts...
node ./node_modules/assemblyscript/bin/asc assembly/index.ts --target release --use abort= --use BUILD_FOR_TESTING=0 --disable sign-extension --config asconfig.json
✨  Done in 4.04s.
```

Once the build completes, you will need to locate your `.wasm` and `.abi` file to upload to the blockchain.

Your `.wasm` file is located in the following directory:

```
/myawesomecontract/build/release/contract.wasm
```
Your `.abi` file is located in the following directory:
```
/myawesomecontract/abi/myawesomecontract.abi
```

Next, we'll create a wallet on the Koinos Blockchain so we can upload our contract.

## Generate a new wallet

To create a wallet, we'll be using `Koinos CLI`. If you arent familiar with how the `Koinos CLI` works, head over to our lesson on [The Koinos CLI](/modules/M1/1_introduction.md) to get started.

Once you have the `Koinos CLI` installed, create a new wallet using the following command:

```
🔐 > create my.wallet azerty
```

Here, we created a new wallet called `my.wallet` and it is encrypted with the password `azerty`.

You should see output similar to this:

```

🔐 > create my.wallet azerty
Created and opened new wallet: my.wallet
Address: 19yp497RPiuWwsNUWp9cHWfbWUupHsRQLE

```

The file `my.wallet` will be generated automatically in the directory where `.koinos-cli` was executed.

You may also use the command `generate` which will display the address and private key, but it will not automatically save the wallet information, you will need to follow up with the import command. If you need to see your address again, you can with the `address` command.

If you are just getting started with Koinos and are trying out our test net, you can grab some free `tKOIN` to interact with the network. Follow the [Using the Discord Faucet](/modules/M1/using-the-faucet) tutorial to get 100 `tKoin`.

Once you get your `tKOIN` from the fountain, you can query your balance with the `koin.balance_of` command which will display your new balance of 100 `tKOIN`. While it appears as `KOIN`, be assured that it is actually `tKOIN` unless you are connected to the main net RPC and have bought real `KOIN` from an exchange.

```
🔓 > koin.balance_of
100 KOIN
```

Now that we have some `tKOIN`, lets upload our smart contract.

## Deploying

We now have a wallet with some `$tKOIN` (or $KOIN if you are on main net). You'll also have a `.wasm` and `.abi` file.


__Remember, if you following this lesson on testnet, use the testnet `koinosrc` file when using Koinos-CLI!__

From `koinos-cli` open your new wallet address and enter the following command to upload the `.wasm` and `.abi` files we created previously:

```
upload myawesomecontract/build/release/contract.wasm myawesomecontract/abi/myawesomecontract.abi
```

You will get the following as a response that includes the transaction ID:

```
Contract uploaded with address 19yp497RPiuWwsNUWp9cHWfbWUupHsRQLE
Transaction with ID 0x122096042fb2e2c085eb4e78cb80a4933e6cda21ebf65722e2c0f283f39a9ba40f2a containing 1 operations submitted.
Mana cost: 0.38643078 (Disk: 16472, Network: 17562, Compute: 177948)
```

Next, we'll interact with this contract.


**Important note:** The wallet/address we use to upload a contract will be the address of the contract itself. This means that the address `19yp497RPiuWwsNUWp9cHWfbWUupHsRQLE` is the address of the wallet we created earlier, but it is also the address of the contract. Smart contracts are users in Koinos. Additionally, the block size limit on the Koinos blockchain is set to 200kb which means that the contract's WASM files cannot exceed this size. If it does, splitting the logic into several smaller contracts would be necessary.  

As you can see, the upload cost us `0.38643078 Mana`. Mana is not a fee, but a regenerative resource intrinsic to each KOIN, which means we didn't spend any actual tKOIN (or KOIN on mainnet) to upload our contract.
  

We can check the transaction on a block explorer to confirm it's been successfully uploaded. 

For harbinger testnet, use [Koinos Blocks for Harbinger](http://harbinger.koinosblocks.com).

For Koions main net, use [Koinos Blocks for Main Net](http://koinosblocks.com)

Since we uploaded our contract to the Harbinger test net, we'll use the second link and search `0x12205d19a5e9fc1a8d12478b7ff761c7b4619b9770404da2dff41d872cd0f0e6fdf8` which brings us to the transaction information, confirming the upload was successful.

## Interacting 

### KoinosBlocks

Since our contract is on the Harbinger Testnet, we'll visit [Koinosblocks - Harbinger Testnet](https://harbinger.koinosblocks.com) and enter the address we just uploaded our contract to in the search box which is `19yp497RPiuWwsNUWp9cHWfbWUupHsRQLE`. Under Read Only methods, open the `hello - Says hello` filed and click read.

![image](images/1_interacting.png)


### CLI

Once the contract is uploaded, we can use our contract with the `Koinos CLI` by registering the address we previously uploaded the contract to. Remember that all koinos address natively support smart contracts so terms like `wallet ID` or `contract address` refer to the same address.

Our smart contract is located at the wallet address `19yp497RPiuWwsNUWp9cHWfbWUupHsRQLE`. This contract is live and you can register it to try it out yourself!

Open the `koinos-cli` and type the following command to register your contract:

```
register myawesomecontract 19yp497RPiuWwsNUWp9cHWfbWUupHsRQLE
```
You will get the following response:

```
Contract 'myawesomecontract' at address 19yp497RPiuWwsNUWp9cHWfbWUupHsRQLE registered
```

By typing `myawesomecontract`, you will automatically get a list of available commands that can be executed with `myawesomecontract`. We'll use the `.hello` entrypoint and provide it with any string to get a response as shown:

```
myawesomecontract.hello anymessage
value:  "Hello, anymessage!"
```

Thats it, great job on your first smart contract! If you're ready, try our [7-day-dApp challenge!](/7_day_dapp/1.0_introduction.md)
