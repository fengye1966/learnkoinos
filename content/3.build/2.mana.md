# Managing Mana

In this module, we'll cover everything you need to know about Mana for both users of dApps and developers. The goal of mana however, is to remove the usage anxiety and mental math casued by gas fees.

On fee based blockchains such as Ethereum, users could pay a fee and still not get their transaction processed, thereby experience a real loss of the transaction fee with no result. Bare in mind, there are several blockchains that have zero fees, but none of them provide a true zero fee experience combined with a general purpose smart contract like Koinos.

With Mana, no tokens are ever lost!

Developers should pay special attention to something called resource credits, otherwise known as `rc` or `rclimits`. Resource Credits is the system that manages how much Mana is available to be consumed by any given wallet. The `koinos-cli` provides a powerful interface to manage `rc`, see [RC Limits](../M1/6_set-rclimit.md).

Let's begin the next section by understanding what Mana is first.

## What is Mana?

Mana is a property of the $KOIN token.

#### NOTE: MANA HAS NO RELATIONSHIP WITH DECENTRALAND! MANA IS NOT A TOKEN!

The name Mana has deep roots, but most users are aware of the term from video games where users have a rate limited ability to run, recover heath, cast magic spells and so forth.

When the ability is limited, the user must "wait it out".

On Koinos, Mana is the ability to use the blockchain without losing tokens to fees. Their usage is rate limited based on how much Mana they have. The more $KOIN they hold, the more Mana they have.

### Understanding Mana With The Car Anology

A convenient way to think about Mana is comparing it to an electric vehicle. 

When someone drivse a typical gas powered car, they consume gas which needs periodic refueling. The larger the gas tank, the further they can drive, but they'll need to buy more gas. This is the typical Ethereum fee based model. Additionally, the cost of gas (priced in ETH) varies, making the model hard to manage for users.

Electric cars on the other hand are powered by electricity which can come from sustainable renewable sources. Bigger batteries allow us to drive further. This is the Koinos zero-fee model. Additionally, if we produce our own renewable energy, the cost of operation is zero making the model easy to manage for users.

When comparing Mana to Gas, the advantages of a Mana model is clearly more beneficial to the end user than Gas.

### Accessing Mana 
There are two ways users can access Mana:

1. Hold $KOIN (direct method).
2. Get Mana through sharing (indirect method)

Let's review how this works next.

## Direct Method

When a user holds $KOIN in their self custody wallet such as `koinos-cli` `Kondor Wallet`, `Portal Wallet`, `Koino` or `My Koinos Wallet`, they'll automatically have access to Mana, just like a charged car is always ready for an adventure. 

The user doesn't have to do anything and will be able to use the Koinos blockchain without losing their $KOIN to transaction fees.

Here is an example with Kondor Wallet. You’ll see that this wallet holds 186,709.727 $KOIN and it has access to an equivalent amount of Mana with a note saying `Mana Recharged`. 

This wallet can interact with any contract and  the Mana will recharge automatically after each transaction.

Next, we'll learn about Mana Sharing, one of the most powerful features of Koinos that will enable tokenless access and aid in mass adoption.

## Mana Sharing (Indirect Method)

Mana sharing is a native feature of the Koinos Blockchain that allows a user who does not have any $KOIN to use the Koinos blockchain, also known as "tokenless access". This indirect method of accessing Mana will allow millions of users who have no idea how to use blockchain, to experience its benefits with zero risk because anyone with $KOIN can share their mana!

Decentralized applications looking to expand their userbase will find Mana sharing especially interesting because they can attract no-coiners (users who don't hold any cryptocurrency at all), which was previously requried an extraordinary effort to onboard.

Mana sharing requires the user to upload a custom smart contract, but projects like Koinos Pro and Koinos Account Protocol (KAP) will both provide no code tools that makes this process simple and user friendly.

#### How to Access Mana Sharing

As of April 2023, there are three interfaces being developed to make this feature easy to access. These interfaces will all be available within several months.

1. __Koinos Account Protocol__ is building `Mana Stations` which give KAP Usernames access to Mana automatically. This helps with anonymity since there is no trace of tokens being transfered and with accessibility since KAP offers a free username tier. [More On KAP](https://kap.domains)

2. __Koinos Pro__ is building `Mana Faucet` which gives dApps who subscribe to Koinos Pro access to Mana for their users. [More on Koinos Pro](https://koinos.io)


#### Incentives to share Mana

There is no direct incentive to share Mana and this was purposely done to ensure maximum flexibility. Free market mechanics dictate how one can access Mana. If Mana is free, than the provider is likely benefiting in other ways. If Mana has a cost, the user has a choice to buy $KOIN or pay for access which results in Mana providers competiting to offer the lowest price possible.


### What happens after you use Mana?

Consuming Mana causes the $KOIN tokens in your wallet to be temporarily locked. Just like our car anology, if you ran out of juice in your electric car, you're going to have to sit and wait until it recharges enough to get you going again.

If a user consistently finds themselves with insufficent Mana, they should get more $KOIN to meet their daily needs.

#### 1 KOIN = 1 MANA
If you have 1 $KOIN, you also have 1 Mana. $KOIN can be broken down into what are commonly refered to as `satoshis`  which is equal to 0.00000001 $KOIN, which means Mana can also be broken down into the same increments.

This equivalency scales linearly too, such that if you have 100,000 $KOIN, you would also have 100,000 Mana. If you use 100,000 Mana in one transaction, you would also have caused 100,000 $KOIN to be temporarily locked. As Mana recharges each second, an equal amount of $KOIN is unlocked and freely available to transfer. The maximum recharge time is 5 days, while the minimum recharge time is 1 second.

## Mana Recharging

Mana recharge math is simple but you don't need to understand it to use it. This section is provided as a guide for technical users who want a deeper explanation.

1 $KOIN is able to recharge at 0.00000231 Mana/Second. Having 2 $KOIN doubles this rate and scales infintely. 

For example, if a user has 1,000 $KOIN,  their recharge rate is 1,000 x 0.00000231 Mana/Second or 0.00231 Mana/Second.

If this user performs a transaction that consumes 0.231 Mana, then they'll have 0.231 $KOIN locked which unlocks at a rate of 0.00231 $KOIN/sec. The total time to unlock all of the $KOIN will be 100 seconds.

To drive the point of scaling home, if this same user were to perform a transaction that consumes twice as much or 0.462 Mana, then they'll have 0.462 $KOIN locked which also unlocks at a rate of 0.00231 $KOIN/sec. The total time to unlock all of the $KOIN will be 200 seconds.

This means that the more $KOIN you hold, the more transactions you can perform within a shorter period of time. This encourages Mana to be pooled together and work collectively and why dApps should aim to gather enough Mana to be able to continuously fuel their operations.

## The price of Mana

Although Mana is free, it represents the ability to access the Koinos blockchain which is an extremely valuable feature because of Mana Sharing which enables tokenless access. 

Critics have pointed out that Mana becomes a defacto fee based system, which it can be for users who have no $KOIN.

But a zero cost, regenerative resource can always be sold at cost, making the pricing predictable unlike gas fees which are extremely unpredictable.

Furthermore, some dApps may opt to provide Mana for free because the user experience of a tokenless dApp removes user cognitive load.

dApps can find a plethora of other ways to monetize their user base. We see examples of this everywhere in the software world. Here are some examples:

- Discord offers users free access to chat platform but they monetize through boost and nitro services.
- Twitter offers users unlimited free tweets, but monetize through twitter plus.
- Linktree offers users free link pages, but monetizes through additional link features.
- Spotify offers free music, but monetizes through Spotify Premium where you can download and listen off line and ad free.
- Linkedin offers free connectivity, but monetizes to get your messages ahead of everyone else’s.
- Tinder offers limited free swipes, but monetizes by offering unlimited swipes in their premium service.
- eBay offers free listings, and you only pay if your item sells.
- Imagine these services were all powered by web3 instead and what benefits web3 could offer, just by providing free access.

The ability to eliminate the cognitive burden of using blockchain is the main value proposition of Mana and Mana sharing.

## Resource credits: RC limit

On the backend, Mana is managed by a `Resource Credit` system. Developers need to manage these limits in their dApps to ensure a smooth user experience.

There are two basic terminologies that must be understood.

Resource Credit: The available amount of Mana. 1 RC = 1 Mana.

RC Limit: The relative amount of Mana that can be spent for any given transaction, expressed in percentage.


Since the Mana cost of a transaction is managed by an AMM that acts in real time, we cannot predict the exact amount of Mana required, however we can be reasonable close, which is why we must set an `RC Limit` which intuitively, puts an upper bound to how much Mana can be consumed in any given transaction.


#### Example:

If `Account 0` has `250 KOIN` then it will also have `250 Mana`.

For any given transaction, if the sender specifies `rclimit = 100%`, then the transaction can consume up to `250 Mana`. 

If the sender specifics `rclimit = 1%` then the transaction can consume up to `2.5 Mana`.

#### Developer Gotcha!

If a sender specifies `rclimit = 100%` and tries to complete 2 consecutive transaction without waiting for their Mana to recharge back to 100%, then the second transaction would not have access to 100% of the resource credits and fail!

___Protip: `rclimit` should be set to the lowest value that the transaction is expected to consume. If you expect it to consume 0.75 Mana, then set the `rclimit` in `Koinos-CLI`, `Kondor` or `KoinosBlocks` (whichever interface you are using) value equal to a percentage that is slightly above 0.75 Mana.___

- For a wallet with 100 $KOIN, use `rclimit = 1%` to allow 1 Mana to be consumed.

- For a wallet with 300 $KOIN, use `rclimit = 0.33%` to allow 1 Mana to be consumed.
