# The Koinos CLI

`Koinos CLI` is the native tool of the Koinos Blockchain that allows a user to interact with all aspects of the Koinos Blockchain. It was developed by Koinos Group and the recommended method to interact with the blockchain, however it is not the only method. Many novice users may find that [KoinosBlocks](https://koinosblocks.com) provides equivalent power with a graphical interface. 

With the Koinos CLI, a user can upload & interact with smart contracts, create and manage multiple wallets, interact with governance and much much more. In this module, we'll go through the full installation and usage of the Koinos CLI for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Let's begin.

### Installing Koinos-CLI

[To download `koinos-cli` visit the github repo here](https://github.com/koinos/koinos-cli).

On the right side is a section called `Releases` where you will find the downloadable binarys to run the application. As of this writing, the current version is `v2.0.0`. 

![github](images/cli_1.png "github")

Clicking on the version number will bring you to the download page where you can grab the binary for your specific operating system. Optionally, some users may want to view the source code and compile it on their own.


Once the binary for your machine is downloaded, open the compressed folder and extract the contents to your prefered location. __Within this folder is a hidden file called `.koinosrc`.__ 

![koinosrc](images/cli_2.png "koinosrc")

If you don't see it, make sure your OS shows hidden files. Open `.koinosrc` in your preferred editor and you will see the following contents:

```
connect https://api.koinos.io/
register_token koin 15DJN4a8SgrbGhhGksSBASiSYjGnMU8dGL
register_token vhp 1AdzuXSpC6K9qtXdCBgD5NUpDNwHjMgrc9
register pob 159myq5YUhhoVWu3wsHKHiJYKPKGUrGiyv
register name_service 19WxDJ9Kcvx4VqQFkpwVmwVEy1hMuwXtQE
register claim 18zw3ZokdfHtudzaWAUnU4tUvKzKiJeN76
register resources 1HGN9h47CzoFwU2bQZwe6BYoX4TM6pXc4b
register governance 19qj51eTbSFJYU7ZagudkpxPgNSzPMfdPX
```

By default, the `.koinosrc` file automatically connects `koinos-cli` to the Koinos Main Net and loads up several smart contracts.

The `connect` command at the top connects you to the ___main net RPC node___ provided by Koinos Group. This is the official API and it is currently free. In the future you may decide to change API nodes, simply change the URL to change the RPC end point.

If you are working on ___The Harbinger Test Net___ you will need to point your wallet to test net nodes and testnet smart contracts. We suggest you replace the entire contents of your `.koinosrc` file with the following information:

```
connect https://harbinger-api.koinos.io/
register_token koin 1FaSvLjQJsCJKq5ybmGsMMQs8RQYyVv8ju
register_token vhp 17n12ktwN79sR6ia9DDgCfmw77EgpbTyBi
register pob 1MAbK5pYkhp9yHnfhYamC3tfSLmVRTDjd9
register name_service 13NQnca5chwpKm4ebHbvgvJmXrsSCTayDJ
register resources 16X6cKyqiT8EzPEksRJxXcqMnHMMm9Vxct
register governance 17MjUXDCuTX1p9Kyqy48SQkkPfKScoggo
```

___💡 Pro tip: Create two folders for `koinos-cli`! One with a `.koinosrc` file specific for test net and another for main net!___

As you become more familiar with using `koinos-cli` you can modify the `.koinosrc` file to suit your needs by adding additional contracts that you use often. We'll go over each of these commands in this module.


## Starting the CLI wallet.

### Windows Users:

Run the executable `koinos-cli.exe`

### Mac and Linus Users:

Open your terminal in the directory of your `koinos-cli` binary and run the following command:

```
./koinos-cli
```
The CLI will automatically use the `.koinosrc` file to connect to either test net or main net, then preload the listed smart contracts.

To see a list of commands that you can call, use the following command
```
list
``` 
The output should be something similar to below. Be aware, if you register additional contracts in the `.koinosrc` file or removed some, this list may appear differently: 

```

```
 

You can also run `help` against any command to learn more about it. Notice that the command `help` always provides `Usage` instructions. 

```

🔐 > help create
Create and open a new wallet file
Usage: create <filename:file> [password:string]

```
In this case, to use the command `create`, you need two additional arguments, one is the name of the file that contains the wallet information, and the password to encrypt the wallet file.

Next, we'll create a new wallet.

## Create a new Koinos Wallet

To create a new Koinos Wallet, we will use the `create` command. As mentioned before, you can always add the `--help` flag to any command and it will provide you with instructions on the usage, heres an example of how that would appear for the `create` command:

```

🔐 > help create
Create and open a new wallet file
Usage: create <filename:file> [password:string]

```

We will now create a new wallet, with a file named `my.wallet` and encrypt the wallet file with the password `azerty`. If successful the output should look like this:

```

🔐 > create my.wallet azerty
Created and opened new wallet: my.wallet
Address: 19yp497RPiuWwsNUWp9cHWfbWUupHsRQLE

```

The `my.wallet` file is an encrypted file that contains the private key to this newly generated wallet. It will be located in the directory where the `koinos-cli` binary was executed from. Please keep this file safe!

**_💡 Pro tip: Place a copy of this file and the `koinos-cli` on a seperate USB that is secured!_**

Another method to create a Koinos wallet is to use the `generate` command which displays the wallet public and private key, but it will not automatically save the wallet information. You will need to record this information and then use the `import` command to create the wallet file.

If you need to see your wallet address again, you can view it by calling the `address` command.

#### Bonus

If you are just getting started with Koinos and are trying out our test net, you can grab some free `tKOIN` to interact with the network. Follow the [Using the Discord Faucet](../M1/using-the-faucet.md) tutorial to get 100 free `tKoin`.

Once you get your `tKOIN` from the fountain, you can query your balance with the `koin.balance_of` command which will display your new balance of 100 `tKOIN`. While it appears as `KOIN`, be assured that it is actually `tKOIN` unless you are connected to the main net RPC and have bought real `KOIN` from an exchange.

```
🔓 > koin.balance_of
100 KOIN
```

## Sending your first Koinos Transaction

Remember that you can always run `help` against any command to learn more about it. Notice that the command `help` always provides `Usage` instructions. Try this with the `koin.transfer` command:

```

🔐 > help koin.transfer
Transfers the token
Usage: koin.transfer <to:address> <amount:amount>

```
In this case, to use the command `koin.transfer`, you need two additional arguments, the first is the `to:address` field which is the destination address, and the other is the `amount:amount` field which is the total amount of $KOIN you wish to transfer. Fill in this information and hit enter. You must have an open wallet to be able to use this command.

___NOTE! When transfering $KOIN or $VHP, the number 1 represents 1 $KOIN. However, when transfering any other token, 1 preresents the smallest denomination of a token or 0.00000001.___


In this example, we will transfer 1 $KOIN from our open wallet to `15NwWEwTFutSPYqMvbYWew44SDxNzdkhAJ`

```

🔓 > koin.transfer 15NwWEwTFutSPYqMvbYWew44SDxNzdkhAJ 1
Transferring 1 KOIN to 15NwWEwTFutSPYqMvbYWew44SDxNzdkhAJ
Transaction with ID 0x12201061fcf45a18e6b2f613ff94b720a7222cc40f4be389f431d921c58980a7f5e5 containing 1 operations submitted.
Mana cost: 0.12764436 (Disk: 0, Network: 311, Compute: 575773)
```

Here we have several bits of information. We see confirmation of our commands, a transaction ID, the number of operations and how much Mana is used.

To confirm this transaction was picked up by the network, we can enter our transaaction ID onto a block explorer like KoinosBlocks.

If using ___Main Net:___ [KoinosBlocks - Main Net](http://koinosblocks.com). 


If using ___Harbinger Test Net:___ [KoinosBlocks - Harbinger Test Net](http://harbinger.koinosblocks.com). 

When using KoinosBlocks to verify transactions, don't mix up main net with test net!

Next, we'll learn how to interact with a smart contract via Koinos CLI.

## Interacting with Smart Contracts

Believe it or not, you've already interacted with a smart contract! The $KOIN token is a system level smart contract that was pre-registered to the `koino-cli` in the `.koinosrc` file!

In this chapter, we will be reviewing how to register new contracts and what you should expect when doing so.  The typical process is:

1. Collect the wallet address for the smart contract you wish to interact with.
2. Register the smart contract with a user defined name.
3. Call the commands begining with the user defined name.

### Collect the wallet address

When interacting with a new contract address, PLEASE BE SURE THAT YOU TRUST THIS CONTRACT FIRST! Interacting with a contract that you do not trust can result in lost of funds. We strongly suggest you use a `smart wallet` to handle interacting with unknown smart contracts! OR follow our Pro Tip below: 


___💡 Pro tip: ALWAYS generate a new wallet and supply it with the minimum number of $KOIN tokens that you need to complete the transaction you wish. For example, if you are interacting with a new NFT contract that cost 100 $KOIN, create a new wallet and send 100 $KOIN + some extra for the Mana cost___

### Register the Smart Contract

In this example, we will be interacting with the Koinos Acccount Protocol's namepsace contract on the `Harbinger Test Net`. The contract address is `1H3k4zttAjF7qfTqfmKZ4ZCdUL3pRdGnpG`. To register the contract, use the following command:

```
🔓 > register namespace 1H3k4zttAjF7qfTqfmKZ4ZCdUL3pRdGnpG
```

You will notice that this is the exact same command located in your `.koinosrc` file! If your register is successful, you will recieve the following response:

```
Contract 'namespace' at address 1H3k4zttAjF7qfTqfmKZ4ZCdUL3pRdGnpG registered
```

When using the register command, the name of the contract is userdefined. We chose to use `namespace` but you can call it anything you wish.

To see what commands are available with this smart contract, use the `list` command and you should see a full list of available commands, including the new contract which you just registered. It will look something like this:

```
...
namespace.set_metadata                    - Set contract metadata
namespace.set_royalties                   - Unsupported
namespace.symbol                          - Returns the token's symbol
namespace.total_supply                    - Gets the total number of minted tokens
namespace.transfer                        - Transfer ownership of a name or TLA
namespace.transfer_ownership              - Transfer ownership of the contract
namespace.uri                             - Returns the token's uri
...
```

Note: If the smart contract was uploaded without an "Application Binary Interface" or `.abi` file, then these entrypoints will not be available and you will get an error.

You may now use the `--help` flag on any of these commands to learn thier usage. This process will apply to any smart contract address.

## RC Limit Settings

RC limits is covered in [Module 2: Mana & RC Limits](/modules/M2/1_introduction.md) however we will briefly review how to set the RC limit in this module. RC refers to resource credits, which is the backend term for Mana. 

### Checking account_rc

If you have a wallet open, you can call the `account_rc` command which will provide a result similar to below:

```
🔓 > account_rc
889430480 rc
```

This particular account has 88940480 RC. If we check the `koin.balance_of` we will recieved the following:

```
🔓 > koin.balance_of
8.89430480 KOIN
```

The decimal places for `account_rc` are reported in whole intergers, while `koin.balance_of` uses floating numbers. In this case, the `account_rc` equals `koin.balance_of` which means that the 100% of the account's Mana is avaialble for use.

### Setting rclimit

Koinos-CLI allows you to set how much `rc` can be consumed by any given transaction using the `rclimit` command. For example, if we want to set the `rclimit` to 10% of our total Mana, we use the following command with the following response:

```
🔓 > rclimit 10%
Set rc limit to 10%
```
If we want to view the current limit, we simply call `rclimit`  which will return the following response:

```🔓 > rclimit
Current rc limit: 10% (0.9)
```
In the above example, `0.9` referes to the explicit amount of Mana available. 

If the `rclimit` is less than the required Mana to complete a transaction, raise your `rclimit` accordingly.

## Using the faucet on Discord

The faucet is a method to gain free testnet $KOIN aka_**tKOIN**_ which is useful for new users trying out Koionos for the firstr time.. This token has no value but is necessary to test development contracts before deploying on main net.

Once you have your public address you can join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GErGNsu) server and request some _**tKOIN**_ in the `#faucet` channel by sending the following message to the faucet bot:

```
!faucet <public address>
```

Example:

```
!faucet 1ENxxuH81kytBdYe81fD9tBdYe81fD9Qxe
```

You can get your balance at any time using the command:

```
!balance <public address>
```

Example:

```
!balance 1ENxxuH81kytBdYe81fD9BdYe81fD9Qxe
```
